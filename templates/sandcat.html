                The 54ndc47 (Sandcat) agent is a program that can easily be deployed on any computer, upon which,
                will form a persistent connection back, allowing an operator to execute adversary
                emulation exercises. 54ndc47 communicates to the server via HTTP(S) by default, but also contains
                additional <i>contact points</i> which redirect the traffic to other protocols. 54ndc47 is written
                in GoLang and dynamically compiles every time it is downloaded, changing its source code slightly to
                ensure a different file hash. 54ndc47 is never <i>installed</i> and can be compiled for nearly any
                operating system just by passing in the correct HTTP headers when downloading it.
